This is just an experiment to test the conpecpt of viralization of a website using the **Open Graph Protocol** meta tags (og:) for social media link preview.

The link preview is generated randomly everytime someone share the link in any social media. 

This can be used in many ways if you are smart enough.

Just like that:

### The Stack:
- Node.js 7.10
- Express
- Express Generator
### Funcionalities:
- API Calls to http://pokeapi.co/ API
- Image and information scraping from https://pokemondb.net using cheerio
- Randomly changes de Open Graph Protocol meta tags in the header.

### How to use:
You can use heroku.com as a free host to this repository.

To start in localhost:

``
npm install
``

``
npm start
``

Go to localhost:8080 to see the project.

Any suggestions would be appreciated :)
